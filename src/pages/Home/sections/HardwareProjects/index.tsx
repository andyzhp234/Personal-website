            description="I successfully built an 8-bit Breadboard Computer from scratch. This unique project involved assembling various modules like a clock module, registers, an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and more on a breadboard, using only basic digital logic chips. The computer follows SAP-1 design, which is a simplified representation of the Von Neumann architecture, and is capable of running basic programs and demonstrates fundamental concepts of computer"
